# Moqui MCP: AI in the Corporate Cockpit

**⚠️ WARNING: THIS DOG MAY EAT YOUR HOMEWORK! ⚠️**

This system can give AI agents god-mode access to an entire ERP system - that's not a feature, it's a loaded weapon requiring serious security consideration.

**AI agents running real business operations.**

## 🚀 **THE POSSIBILITIES**

### **Autonomous Business Operations**
- **AI Purchasing Agents**: Negotiate with suppliers using real inventory data
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust prices based on live demand and supply constraints  
- **Workforce Intelligence**: Optimize scheduling with real financial modeling
- **Supply Chain Orchestration**: Coordinate global logistics automatically

### **Real-World Intelligence**
- **Market Analysis**: AI sees actual sales data, not just trends
- **Financial Forecasting**: Ground predictions in real business metrics
- **Risk Management**: Monitor operations for anomalies and opportunities
- **Compliance Automation**: Enforce business rules across all processes

### **The Agentic Economy**
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Sales, purchasing, operations AI working together
- **ECA/SECA Integration**: Event-driven autonomous decision making
- **Cross-Company Coordination**: AI agents negotiating with other AI agents
- **Economic Simulation**: Test strategies in real business environment

ERP systems naturally create the perfect **agentic theater** - casting distinct roles around HR, Sales, Production, Accounting, and more. This organizational structure provides a powerful grounding framework where AI agents can inhabit authentic business personas with clear responsibilities, workflows, and relationships. The departmental boundaries and process flows that govern human collaboration become the stage directions for autonomous agents, turning corporate hierarchy into a narrative engine for AI coordination.

**Every product you touch passed through an inventory system. Now AI touches back.**

## Overview

This implementation provides the **foundational bridge** between AI assistants and real-world business operations through Moqui ERP. It exposes the complete corporate operating system - screens, services, entities, workflows, and business rules - as MCP tools with **recursive discovery** to arbitrary depth.

**Think of this as giving AI agents actual jobs in real companies, with real responsibilities, real consequences, and real accountability.**

## Architecture

The implementation consists of:

- **EnhancedMcpServlet** - Main MCP servlet handling JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
- **McpServices** - Core services for initialization, tool discovery, and execution
- **Screen Discovery** - Recursive screen traversal with XML parsing
- **Security Integration** - Moqui artifact authorization system
- **Test Suite** - Java/Groovy tests (help please!)
