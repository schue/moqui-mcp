Development since yesterday has focused on enhancing the MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface with significant improvements to session management, permissions, and entity support. Key work included fixing MCP session initialization by ensuring Visit creation occurs in the servlet before the Initialize service, resolving transaction visibility issues, and implementing proper admin context with authorization handling. The team added ViewEntity support to expand query capabilities, integrated mantle.product.PriceServices.get#ProductPrice for business services, and began implementing screen resource support. Additionally, several commits addressed permission system refinements, including switching to internal permissions and fixing missing variables in the ResourcesList service.
